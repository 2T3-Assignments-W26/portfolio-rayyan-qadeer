# KAIRO News - Artifical News Website

## Description
Kairo News is an artifical news-style website developed by me as part of a User Interfaces assignment. The project focuses on layout structure, semantic HTML, CSS styling, and appealing visual presentation. Infact, the goal of the assignment was to design a clean and easy to read news page using modern presentation in Visual Studio Code.

## Technologies Used

- Visual Studio Code
- HTML
- CSS
- Google

## Key Features

- Well structured layout
- Custom styling
- Images
- Presentable spacing adjustments
- Organized folder structure

## Code snippets

#### Main code
```
<body> 

    <!-- Top Container Area--> 
    <div class="header"> 
      <h2>KAIRO NEWS</h2> 
      <p class="subtitle"> 
        <i>Keeping all information ridiculously optimistic</i> 
      </p> 
      <h1>PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY was... SLAIN ?!</h1> 
      <!-- Cover image--> 
      <img class="coverImage"  src="./assets/images/jfkcar.png" alt="car" /> 
    </div> 
```
### Styling code
```
img { 
  width: 300px; 
} 

body { 
  text-align: center; 
  background-color: blanchedalmond; 
} 

h1 { 
  background-color: bisque; 
} 

h2 { 
  background-color: rgb(128, 128, 117); 
} 

.ad { 
  background-color: #f8f8f8; 
  border-bottom: 1px solid #dfdfdf; 
  border-top: 1px solid #dfdfdf; 
  margin-top: 40px; 
  margin-bottom: 40px; 
  padding-bottom: 20px; 
  width: 100%; 
  height: 100%; 
  object-fit: cover; 
} 

.main p { 
  text-align: left; 
} 

@font-face { 
  font-family: "news title"; 
  src: url(../assets/fonts/Kings/Kings-Regular.ttf); 
} 

@font-face { 
  font-family: "article title"; 
  src: url(../assets/fonts/Italianno/Italianno-Regular.ttf); 
} 

body { 
  font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; 
} 
h1 { 
  font-family: "article title", Times, serif;
  font-size: 3rem; 
} 

h2 { 
  font-family: "news title", Times, serif; 
  font-size: 3rem; 
  font-weight: 100; 
}  
  ```

## What I Learned
In short, I learned more on proper HTML structuring, how to use css to design and style content in HTML, and the importance of having clean folder organization.

# Fish Escape - C# Console Game

## Description
Fish Escape is a game I built in C# where the user controls a fish character and tries to survive while collecting coins to level up. The game includes a chaser enemy (a shark), moving hazards to avoid (a jellyfish), and randomized powerups that spawn accross the playing area that change your gameplay. The way that the player wins is by reaching the final level by succesfully collecting enough coins before running out of lives.

## Technologies Used

- Visual Studio 2022
- C#

## Key Features
- Player movement with arrow keys
- Enemy object
- Hazard objects
- Coin collection
- Powerups
- Collision detection

## Code snippets

#### Shark Movement
```
static void MoveShark()
{
    if (FreezeTimer > 0)
        return;

    if (SYNC_FPS % SHARK_SPEED != 0)
        return;
    
    if (SharkX < MeX) SharkX++;
    if (SharkX > MeX) SharkX--;
    if (SharkX < MeY) SharkX++;
    if (SharkX > MeY) SharkX--;

    CheckSharkCollision();
}
```

#### Scoring
```
if (FishCoversCell(CoinX, Coin Y))
{
    int gain = 1;
    if (DoubleTimer > 0)
        gain = 2;

    Score += gain;
    SpawnCoin();
    LevelCheck();
}
``` 

## What I Learned
In short, I learned how to structure a proper game using loops. I also improved my own understanding of collision detection. Continuing on, this project helped me think a bit more critically about how different things in a program interact with eachother. Finally, this helped me learn how to organize large amounts of code in a more clean and structured way.
