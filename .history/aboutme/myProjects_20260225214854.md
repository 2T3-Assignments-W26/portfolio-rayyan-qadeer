# Fish Escape - C# Console Game

## Description
Fish Escape is a game I built in C# where the user controls a fish character and tries to survive while collecting coins to level up. The game includes a chaser enemy (a shark), moving hazards to avoid (a jellyfish), and randomized powerups that spawn accross the playing area that change your gameplay. The way that the player wins is by reaching the final level by succesfully collecting enough coins before running out of lives.
